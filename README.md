As a Customer Service Agent, I need an easily-accessible list of flights arriving soon at the airport I work at, so that I know when to meet incoming flights.
 
Acceptance criteria:
 
– The Agent can enter the three letter airport code they want arrival information for.

– The app should remember the airport that was previously selected.

– The list should display the flight number, three-letter origin airport code, and arrival time of the flight, in local time for the user.

– The list should show the flights arriving for the next hour, ordered by arrival time, with soonest at the top. 

– If the user force-quits and returns to the app, the list should still be visible.

– The app should not display data that is more than 1 minute old.
